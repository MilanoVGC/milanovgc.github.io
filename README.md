# MilanoVGC Tournament Viewer

[![Process Tournament TDF Upload](https://github.com/MilanoVGC/milanovgc.github.io/actions/workflows/process_tournament.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/MilanoVGC/milanovgc.github.io/actions/workflows/process_tournament.yml)

A static website hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to display live pairings, results, and final standings for MilanoVGC Pok√©mon VGC tournaments. Data is processed automatically from Tournament Organizer Manager (TOM) `.tdf` exports using GitHub Actions.

**Live Site:** [https://milanovgc.github.io/](https://milanovgc.github.io/)

## Features

*   **Live Pairings:** View current round pairings for ongoing tournaments.
*   **Auto-Refresh:** Tournament pages automatically check for updated data every 15 seconds.
*   **Swiss Standings:** Displays final Swiss standings (Rank, Player, Record, OWP%, OOWP%) after the last Swiss round is completed.
    *   Uses calculation logic derived from observed TOM behavior (WP = Max(MatchWins / (RoundsParticipated - Byes), 0.25), no intermediate rounding).
*   **Top Cut Navigation:** Cleanly separates Swiss round tabs from Top Cut stage tabs (e.g., "Top 8", "Top 4", "Finals").
*   **Player Search:** Filter pairings tables by player name.
*   **Responsive Design:** Adapts layout for different screen sizes (desktop, mobile).
*   **Automated Processing:** Tournament data files (`.tdf`) uploaded to a specific folder trigger a GitHub Action to automatically generate the necessary pages and update the tournament list.

## How it Works

The system leverages GitHub Actions and GitHub Pages for a mostly automated workflow:

1.  **TDF Export:** A tournament organizer exports the current tournament data from TOM software as a `.tdf` file.
2.  **Admin Upload:**
    *   The organizer navigates to the (potentially private) `admin_upload.html` page.
    *   They enter a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) with `repo` scope and select the `.tdf` file.
    *   The `assets/upload.js` script reads the file and uses the GitHub API (via the user's browser) to upload the `.tdf` file directly into the `incoming/` directory of the `main` branch.
3.  **GitHub Action Trigger:**
    *   The push to `incoming/` triggers the `.github/workflows/process_tournament.yml` workflow.
4.  **Workflow Execution:**
    *   Checks out the repository code.
    *   Installs necessary command-line tools: `xmlstarlet` (for XML parsing) and `jq` (for JSON processing, though currently optional).
    *   Finds the newly uploaded `.tdf` file in `incoming/`.
    *   Extracts the tournament name and date using `xmlstarlet`.
    *   Creates a sanitized, URL-friendly folder name based on the tournament name (e.g., `monkey-cup-vg-16-03-2025`).
    *   Generates a basic `index.html` file inside the new tournament folder. This file contains the structure for displaying pairings and standings and links to the shared CSS and JS assets.
    *   Moves the uploaded `.tdf` file into the `Tournament-Folder/data/` directory and renames it to `tournament_data.xml`.
    *   Regenerates the **root `index.html`** file (the homepage). It scans the repository for all tournament folders, attempts to read the proper tournament name from each tournament's HTML `<title>` tag, and creates a list of links (styled as cards) pointing to each tournament's page.
    *   Configures git with bot credentials.
    *   Adds all new/modified files (the new tournament folder with its HTML/XML, the updated root `index.html`, and the removal of the TDF from `incoming/`).
    *   Commits these changes with a descriptive message.
    *   Pushes the commit back to the `main` branch.
5.  **GitHub Pages Deployment:**
    *   GitHub Pages automatically detects the push to the `main` branch and serves the updated static files.
6.  **User Experience:**
    *   A user visits `https://milanovgc.github.io/`.
    *   The browser loads the root `index.html`, which displays the list of available tournaments (styled as cards).
    *   The user clicks on a tournament card link (e.g., `./monkey-cup-vg-16-03-2025/`).
    *   The browser navigates to the corresponding `Tournament-Folder/index.html`.
    *   `assets/style.css` is loaded to apply the visual theme.
    *   `assets/script.js` executes:
        *   Fetches the specific `data/tournament_data.xml` for that tournament.
        *   Parses the XML to extract player info and round/match data.
        *   Dynamically generates the round navigation tabs (including Top Cut stages).
        *   Displays pairings for the current round, including player scores.
        *   Adds functionality to the search bar.
        *   Determines the latest *completed* Swiss round. If it's the *final* Swiss round, it calculates and displays the Swiss standings (OWP, OOWP).
        *   Sets up an interval timer (`setInterval`) to periodically re-fetch the `tournament_data.xml` and update the UI if changes are detected (auto-refresh).

## Setup & Configuration

*   **`assets/upload.js`:** The `repoOwner` and `repoName` constants must be set correctly for the GitHub API upload to function.
*   **GitHub PAT:** The admin uploading the TDF needs a GitHub Personal Access Token with the `repo` scope selected. This token should be kept secure and is entered directly on the upload page (ensure HTTPS is used).

## Usage

**Admin:**

1.  Export the tournament data from TOM as a `.tdf` file.
2.  Navigate to `admin_upload.html` on the live site.
3.  Paste your GitHub PAT into the appropriate field.
4.  Select the exported `.tdf` file.
5.  Click "Upload & Process File".
6.  Monitor the status box and wait for the GitHub Actions workflow to complete (can be viewed in the repository's "Actions" tab).

**User:**

1.  Visit the main site URL: [https://milanovgc.github.io/](https://milanovgc.github.io/)
2.  Click on the desired tournament card/link.
3.  Use the round tabs/stage buttons to navigate pairings.
4.  Standings appear automatically below pairings once the final Swiss round is complete.
5.  The page automatically checks for updates periodically.

## Technology Stack

*   **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Vanilla)
*   **Hosting:** GitHub Pages
*   **Automation:** GitHub Actions
*   **Workflow Tools:**
    *   Shell Scripting (Bash)
    *   `xmlstarlet` (XML parsing)
    *   `jq` (JSON processing - included but may not be actively used in current manifest update)
    *   Python (for robust HTML escaping in workflow)
*   **Data Format:** XML (`.tdf` export from TOM)

## Potential Improvements / TODO

*   **Refactor to SPA:** Convert the project to a Single Page Application framework (Vue, React, Svelte) or use vanilla JS routing more extensively for a smoother user experience (Level 2 approach discussed previously).
*   **Admin Page Security:** The current `admin_upload.html` relies solely on the PAT. Consider adding authentication or moving upload functionality outside the static site if security is a major concern.
*   **Error Handling:** Improve error display and recovery in both the workflow and the frontend JavaScript.
*   **Design:** Further refine the UI/UX based on user feedback.
*   **Testing:** Add automated tests for standings calculation logic.
*   **Manifest Robustness:** Improve the reliability of extracting the display name when generating the root `index.html`.
